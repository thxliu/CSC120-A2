Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I feel that after working on this assignment, I have a better understanding of using classes and how OOP is different from procedural programming by dividing the code into parts and storing specific data into those parts so that they act as objects. Although the purpose of this assignment is to use a completely different approach to Python than 110, I found that I could still use the same functions and commands to figure out the code. For example, using lists and actions like append and pop were concepts we learned in 110 that serve a purpose in this assignment as well, but the data appended or popped is now stored in an object. 

I still feel pretty unsure of my grasp on OOP overall as it is still a bit of an untangible concept to me. Additionally, I was confused on how we were supposed to know which methods to call upon and what the parameters of functions like sell or refurbish are. 

My advice would be to really familiarize yourself with the procedural_resale_shop.py and main.py so that you have a general idea of the methods needed for oo_resale_shop.py and computer.py are. Also, I highly recommend going to TA hours and office hours as I found this assignment to be considerably confusing and overwhelming before working with someone to break it down further and relate it more to concepts covered in 110 so it wasn't as foreign.
